Description: This project is based on the data processing application for a microcontroller. It will utilize a circular buffer data structure, configure a microcontroller along with the use of peripherals which include: clock systems, genereal perpose input/output (GPIO) and a Universal Asynchronous Receive Transmit (UART) module. Also it contains unit test code using the Cmocka unit test framework.

Functionality: It processes data after taking 20 elements from the terminal and gives a complete statistics (count) of the data elements such as alphabets, numbers, punctuations and miscellaneous characters.
